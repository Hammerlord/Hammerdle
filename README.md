## Hammerdle

A rip-off of the popular game, Wordle. The basic functionality of this project was put together in about half a day of cowboy coding/scraping a MapleStory database for 5-word terms. (Don't ask about the MapleStory thing... the obscure MapleStory terminology is now sequestered under the settings, so you can play with a bank of ~2800 normal words instead.)

The word bank is a partly-vetted collection of 5 letter words found all over the internet, not based on the original Wordle.

There's no cooldown, so you can play until you're sick of it, like me!
